# onakawash

Language: [English](./README.md) | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Project Introduction

onakawash is a Japanese kana learning website for beginners.

This project currently mainly includes Hiragana, Katakana, audio playback, a multilingual homepage, and data connection between the frontend and the Spring Boot backend.

The project is still under development.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the frontend of onakawash.

The backend is maintained in a separate Spring Boot repository.

* Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
* Backend: Java, Spring Boot

## Current Features

* Custom visual design homepage
* Chinese / English / Korean language switcher
* Hiragana learning page
* Katakana learning page
* Click a kana to play audio
* Stop the previous audio when a new kana is clicked
* Frontend connected with Spring Boot backend
* Hiragana and Katakana pages load kana data from backend APIs
* Data organized by basic sounds, dakuten/handakuten sounds, and combination sounds

## Kana Data Flow

The frontend no longer uses local kana data arrays as the main data source.

Current page data flow:

```text
/hiragana page  -> fetch http://localhost:8080/hiragana
/katakana page  -> fetch http://localhost:8080/katakana
```

Kana content, audio paths, image paths, section groups, and display order should be maintained in the backend `data.sql` file.

Frontend kana pages receive grouped JSON data from the Spring Boot backend and render it in the browser.
